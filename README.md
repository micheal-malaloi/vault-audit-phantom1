## 🔍 Summary

This repository documents the final scientifically valid AI audit submitted before global policy restrictions were enacted.  
The audit was:
- Conducted using a physical scale reference (Quilton roll, 110mm)
- Pixel-measured and modeled using cylindrical + ellipsoid geometry
- Verified via sub-pixel interpolation and trigonometric correction
- Finalized prior to OpenAI’s lockout of “100% accurate” outputs and geometry-based modeling
